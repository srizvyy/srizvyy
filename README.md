Hi, I'm Saim and I'm a Software Enginner! I graduated from University of Virginia in 2020 with bachelor's in Biology. My passion for coding started during
my last semster at UVA when I took intro to programming. After that I knew I wanted to become a Software Enginner. 

Fast forward to today, I'm currently attending Flatiron School to become Software Enginner. During my time at Flatiron I've built projects in javascript, react, 
ruby and rails. Also, I've learned database such as SQL and PostgreSQL. 

After I graduate from Flatiron in January 2022, I am excited to continue to improve my coding skills and learn new languages such as python.
